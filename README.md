Generate new string between two given strings for lexicographic sorting

## Install
```
go get -u github.com/tolgaOzen/lexicographic-sort
```

## Test
```
go test
```

## Examples

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abcde", "abchi"))
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abc", "abchi"))
}

// abcf
// abcd
```

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abhs", "abit"))
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abh", "abit"))
}

// abhw
// abhn
```


```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abhz", "abit"))
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abhzs", "abit"))
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abhzz", "abit"))
}

// abhzn
// abhzw
// abhzzn
```

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abc", "abcah"))
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abc", "abcab"))
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abc", "abcaah"))
    fmt.Println(GenerateBetween("abc", "abcb"))
}

// abcad
// abcaan
// abcaad
// abcan
```


## Motivation
My client asked me for the task management application that the user can custom sort items. My first thought was to open a numeric column for the items. This was a really bad idea. Because when the order of one item changed, the order of all items had to change. It was a bad process that exhausted the system and the database.
Through my research, I realized that lexicographic sorting allows for tons of breathing room between sorted items.
I've learned that for each item you want to reorder, it's as easy as just generating a new string between items above and below the range you want to put.
